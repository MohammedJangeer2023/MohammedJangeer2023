## Hi there 👋 My name is Mohammed Jangeer

I'm from Lancashire, England, currently in Western European Time 🌎 I'm keen to learn and develop software and participate in diverse projects 💻. When I'm not problem-solving or creating projects, I love to go mountain hiking. 

- 🔭 I'm working on my first Tailwind project, designing a replica of the Facebook page. 
- 🌱 I recently built my first game, Slither, using JavaScript, CSS and HTML. 
- 👯 I'm looking to join a collaborative comprehensive company and help build upon my skills in a work environment.
